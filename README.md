this is a primer assignment for HHA 504/507

## Summary
The first variable I created was:
```
temperature = float(input('Please Enter Your Current Body Temperature: '))
```
This was to ask the user to input their current body temperature. This is an example of a number (and float) variable. 

The next variable I created was:
```
name = input("Please Enter Your Name: ")
```
This was to ask the user to input their name. This is an example of a string variable.

I then went to put this:
```
print('Welcome back', name,',', 'from my observations:')
```
This is just a print function to welcome the user.
